### Learnings from the Workshop:

I have learned the following things from this workshop:

1. **Version Control System & Git:**
   - I learned about version control systems and repositories, which help in tracking changes to code and collaborating with teams.
   - I got hands-on experience configuring Git in the terminal (commonly used in Linux/Debian or Bash in Windows) to commit and push code to a GitHub repository. 
   - Other editors like Nano and Atom are also used to configure Git for tasks like editing commit messages and other Git-related actions.

2. **Proxy:**
   - I learned about proxies, which act as intermediaries between computers and the internet. They are used for security, traffic management, and more.

#### Commands:
- **To enable proxy:**
  ```bash
  git config --global http.proxy proxy-url
  git config --global https.proxy proxy-url
git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
