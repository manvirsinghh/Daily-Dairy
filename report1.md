### Learnings from the Workshop:

I have learned the following things from this workshop:

. **Version Control System & Git:**
   - I learned about version control systems and repositories, which help in tracking changes to code and collaborating with teams.
   - I got hands-on experience configuring Git in the terminal (commonly used in Linux/Debian or Bash in Windows) to commit and push code to a GitHub repository. 
   - Other editors like Nano and Atom are also used to configure Git for tasks like editing commit messages and other Git-related actions.
